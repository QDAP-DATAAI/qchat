# Understanding facts in {{APP_NAME}}: a simple guide ✨

This guide is designed to help you navigate through the occasional inaccuracies you might encounter while using {{APP_NAME}}, our friendly writing assistant.

## What are mistakes in {{APP_NAME}}? 🤖

Imagine {{APP_NAME}} as a keen but sometimes overenthusiastic friend who attempts to fill in gaps in stories or facts, but doesn’t always get it right. These inaccuracies are what we call "mistakes", they are also commonly referred to as "hallucinations".

## Why do mistakes happen? 🧐

{{APP_NAME}} absorbs vast amounts of text to predict and generate responses based on patterns. However, it doesn't truly "understand" this information. So, when it tries to provide details without complete data, it might make incorrect guesses. But the remainder of the text is still largely valuable, we can simply let it know the facts to change and we're off to the races.

## Example: mixing up details 📝

If you ask {{APP_NAME}} about a scientist named Dr. Emily Stanton, expecting a summary of her work, it might say, "Dr. Emily Stanton, known for her pioneering research in astrophysics, won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2018."

Here, {{APP_NAME}} has made mistakes:

- Dr. Stanton is a marine biologist, not an astrophysicist.
- She hasn’t won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry.

{{APP_NAME}} has "imagined" incorrect details about Dr. Stanton's career.
