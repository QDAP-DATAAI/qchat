# Welcome to {{APP_NAME}}

Before you start chatting with our automated assistant, we need to share a few important points to make sure you understand how to best use this service and what to expect.

## What Is This Service?

{{APP_NAME}} is a text-based virtual assistant powered by a Large Language Model, not a real human. It's designed to help you with day-to-day tasks in your role, such as drafting correspondence or developing written content, help you brainstorm ideas or solve problems, and point you in the right direction for further thinking or research.

## Security First

Privacy and security are paramount in {{AGENCY NAME}}. You can share most {{AGENCY NAME}} information with {{APP_NAME}} (unlike ChatGPT and others) but please don’t share any information that could be classified PROTECTED or above.

## Not The Last Word

While our virtual assistant is pretty smart, it's not always perfect. The conversations you have here should be just the starting point for further exploration and not the final word. For detailed advice tailored to your situation, it's always best to consult with experienced professionals.

## Record-Keeping

Just a heads-up that we keep records of these conversations to make our service better. But don't worry, all data is stored securely in Australia and we’ve completed a robust security and privacy impact assessment.

## If Something Goes Wrong

Mistakes can happen and Large Language Models are not perfect. If {{APP_NAME}} provides information that is incorrect, contains bias, or any other issue, we're really sorry. We encourage you to report the issue through our feedback tool so we can improve the service.
