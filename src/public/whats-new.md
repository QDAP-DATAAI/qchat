## 👨🏻‍💻 Version 1.4.1 Updates - 26 APR 2024

- **Display Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level Feature:** We've introduced a new feature for understand readability scores. This score reflects the education grade level a person would need to be in to understand the text. For example, a score of 8 means that an eighth grader can understand the document (typically around 13-14 years old) . For most documents, please aim for a Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level score that corresponds to a reading age of 12 or below. Adding five to the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level score provides the approximate reading age of your document.

## 👨🏻‍💻 Version 1.3.8 Updates - 15 APR 2024

- **Minor Software Changes:** This update has some security enhancements to keep QChat secure and ready to assist you!

## 🛡️ Version 1.3.7 Updates - 12 APR 2024

- **Enhanced Content Safety Measures:** This update introduces significant improvements to our content safety protocols. QChat will now more effectively identify messages that potentially breach our content safety guidelines. Such messages will be flagged with a clear warning. Furthermore, if three messages in a conversation are flagged for content safety violations, the ongoing conversation will be locked to prevent the exchange of new messages. We encourage users to make use of the feedback options provided if they encounter any messages that they believe should have been flagged but were not. This helps us continually refine and enhance our content safety measures.

## 🆕 Version 1.3.5 Updates - 5 APR 2024

- **Display Name Context:** Since version 1.3.5, QChat now has access to your Display Name as additional context when responding to you. This enhancement aims to personalise your interaction with QChat further.

## ✨ New Features

- **Copy Chat to Clipboard & Export Documents:** You can now easily copy your chat to the clipboard or export it as a document for your records. These options are available next to the text input bar in the chat interface.
- **Watermarking:** Please note that text copied from QChat has watermarking. It indicates "Text generated by QChat," and for code, it says "Code Language generated by QChat," with the note being commented out. This feature helps identify the source of the information for reference and integrity.

## 🚀 UI and Accessibility Improvements

- Significant UI and accessibility changes have been made to ensure a more user-friendly and inclusive experience for all users. These improvements aim to enhance navigation, readability, and overall interaction with QChat.
